Sitting in the Nurnberg airport and waiting for boarding is a good moment to look back at this awesome week. In short I had a chance to join another [Neos](http://neos.io) code sprint and participate in [TYPO3 Developer Days](http://t3dd15.typo3.org) (for the first time).

The week started for me on Monday morning with a pleasant surprise: Sebastian Kurfürst with guys from Sandstorm media were waiting for me in the airport to give me a ride in his Saab packed full with Mac keyboards, some huge screens and other equipment prepared for the sprint.

I like the habit of the Neos team of [generally preferring ancient castles](http://dimaip.github.io/2014/10/05/the-code-sprint/) to other more modern locations. This time it was the Imperial Castle of Nuremberg, built in XIth century. I stayed in the top floor of the castle, with a nice overview of the whole town, which was very useful since we did not have a lot of time for walks.

The main goal of the sprint was releasing 2.0, but I had to spend most time working on a wizard for node creation feature for Neos, as we desperately need it to ease the life of our editors at SFI.ru and that was one of the main reasons my company sent me to the sprint.
Thomas had an initiative to join me brainstorming this feature, and by the end of the end we worked out a great specification how it could work. Then we had split out duties into him implementing the backend side and me going to the JavaScript jungle to implement the frontend. By the end of the second day the backend part of spectacularily implemented by Thomas, but I really got stuck decoupling Inspector editors to be reusable throghout the interface. Bad experience is often the most valuable one, because that's where you learn and also become humble about your abillities (which does never hurt). I've learned a lot more about JavaScript and Ember in particular, so I hope to continue working on this feature in the spare time the following month (hint: if you want to speed up the development of this feature you can sponsor it).

The most inspiring thing for me was the ammount of new contributors joining the sprint. You guys are really awesome developers and I hope you are here to stay! In general it feels that the Neos core is getting to be surrounded by real community of passionate and highly qualified developers sharing the same spirit.
We have had quite some time with Tyll developing proposal for frontend refactoring (which is so desperately needed!), and later had a very fruitful discussion with team members.

Guys were working days and nights (literally) on delivery 2.0, and by the time I left there were only just a few bugs left, so you can expect the release in the following weeks.

The TYPO3 Developer Days event was very interesting too. First of all it was really well organised, and be thanks go to Thomas Maroshic, Andi and many many others who took a really great care to make even new contributors like me feel comfortable on such big event.

The format was a bit innovative and organizers had to adjust in the middle of the event, but eventually it worked like this: speakes presented their session in a 8-minute lightning talk format, then participats would vote for the session they wanted to join and then the sessions would run in parallel tracks. Because I had to host two sessions myself, I had a change to only join one session: Christian Muller introducing Neos 2.0.

Obviously I already knew all there is new in 2.0 release, but when you look at all features combined together, that makes quite an impression! I am greatly inspired to be somehow related to what is going on with Neos project at the moment.

I had handed out two session proposals for dev days, lying at oposing poles of web development stack: Docker 101 and CSS Architecture. It was the first experience for me speaking in public and it was not as scary as I had imagined :) Plenty of people were interested in Docker, but to my utter surprise, even more decided to join my CSS session! That speaks of a big tech diversity in TYPO3 and Neos communities and is really inspiring: we have a lot to share with each other!

Here are the slides, by the way:
- Docker 101
- Your CSS code needs an architect

In the last day of my stay I met Eugene, a very bright and inspiring person, TYPO3 developer and a real christian. We dicussed a very important question for me: how to be a great developer, but at the same time not making technology your god (or idol?). There are quite some challenges a christian person faces when working in tech, and it could be interesting to form some kind of group of christians in our communities. Christianity is anything but a private matter, and Kasper Skårhøj showed it very well in the early days of TYPO3 community.
